# FaceMask_Detection
A simple project which runs a ML model to binary classify a person or a group with and without ask.

This project is focused on face mask detection ,we will discuss our two-phase COVID-19 face mask
detector, detailing how our computer vision/deep learning pipeline will be implemented. From there, we’ll
review the dataset we’ll be using to train our custom face mask detector. Will then show you how to
implement a Python script to train a face mask detector.
